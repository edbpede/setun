 * Block until the application server is answering.

 * Playwright starts every `webServer` entry at once, and the application's entry
 * is the one that runs `vite build`. The first-run suite's server needs that
 * build to exist before `bun ./build/index.js` means anything, so its command
 * waits here first.
 *
 * A readiness poll rather than a file check: `build/index.js` appears partway
 * through the build, and a server started from a half-written bundle fails in a
 * way that looks like a product bug.
