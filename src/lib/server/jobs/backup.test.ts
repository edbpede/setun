/**
 * The nightly snapshot (PRD §21, Appendix A).
 *
 * §21 asks for "SQLite online backup via `VACUUM INTO` plus the images and
 * skills directories, last 14 days retained on the volume". Skill bodies and
 * resources are database columns in this implementation (§19), so what lives
 * outside the database is the storage tree, and the tests below check that the
 * snapshot is a database another connection can read, that the storage tree
 * travels with it, and that the fourteen-day window is by name rather than by
 * mtime — a restored volume carries whatever mtimes the copy gave it.
