/**
 * The in-process job scheduler (PRD §6, §16, §21).
 *
 * §6 puts the scheduler inside the application rather than beside it: three
 * containers, one of which is the app, and no fourth for cron. Development runs
 * the Vite dev server under Node while production runs the adapter-node build
 * under Bun, so this is `setInterval` and nothing Bun-specific — `Bun.cron`
 * would work in production and silently not exist in dev.
 *
 * What the scheduler guarantees, and jobs therefore need not: a job never runs
 * concurrently with itself, a throwing job does not stop the timer or take the
 * process down, and stopping is complete.
 *
 * Jobs are idempotent and time-driven rather than tick-driven — each decides
 * from the clock what is due — so a missed tick over a restart costs nothing and
 * an extra one does nothing.
