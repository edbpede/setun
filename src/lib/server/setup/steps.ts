 * live here, so a step's behaviour can be tested without a request.
 *
 * Every function is idempotent against its own step's derivation predicate. That
 * is the property that makes back-navigation safe: the alias step updates the
 * alias the derivation found rather than inserting a second one, and the same
 * for the classroom. Provisioning is the exception by nature — a second batch is
 * a second batch, and the UI says so rather than pretending otherwise.
 *
 * Nothing here writes `setupCompletedAt` except `finishSetup`. Opening the gate
 * from a step that has three steps after it would hand the educator a panel that
 * cannot serve a lesson.
