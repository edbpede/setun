/**
 * What the model is told about the artifacts it has already written (PRD §13).
 *
 * Three jobs, from one read of the conversation's versions:
 *
 * 1. **The state note.** A short list of what exists — id, language, revision,
 *    who wrote it last, and how it ran. Without it a model cannot know which id
 *    to reuse, and cannot know that the thing it wrote did not run at all.
 * 2. **Superseded-source elision.** Full rewrites are the update mechanism, so
 *    the path holds every version of every artifact in full. Left alone, a
 *    fourth revision of a page sends four copies of that page — the input grows
 *    without bound, and the model has three obsolete versions of its own file to
 *    confuse with the current one. So a block whose artifact's current source
 *    appears *later* in the same conversation is replaced by a line saying so.
 *
 * 3. **Carried sources.** The same read answers the opposite question: which
 *    artifacts' current sources the path does *not* hold. A pupil who edits an
 *    earlier prompt sends a path from a different branch of the message tree,
 *    and the artifact the model wrote on the branch they left is named by the
 *    state note and present nowhere. So its complete source travels behind the
 *    note, in the same never-persisted slot.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately conservative: nothing is elided unless the current
 * source is demonstrably present further down the same path. A block that is the
 * newest copy the model will see is always sent in full.
 *
 * Presence is decided by identity and not by text alone — a block counts for the
 * artifact its `id=` names, and an id-less block only when its text names exactly
 * one artifact. Both questions use the same rule, so an artifact can never be
 * both elided against a copy that is not its own and left uncarried because of it.
