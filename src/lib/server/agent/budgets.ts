 *
 *  1. Per-turn caps — steps, wall-clock, tokens. These are *checkpoints*: the
 *     turn pauses at its next clean boundary and asks the pupil whether to
 *     continue, and continuing grants the same allotment again.
 *  2. Per-student daily allowance — so one pupil cannot drain the class.
 *  3. Per-classroom daily cap — the ceiling for the whole class.
 *
 * Layers 2 and 3 are the hard ceilings, and they bind both when a turn starts
 * and while one runs, so a single turn cannot overshoot the day by a whole
 * allotment. Layer 1 no longer cuts a response mid-sentence — it stops a runaway
 * loop by asking, which is a question a pupil watching an answer can answer.
