 * answered with the quiz alone — a correct answer to the question asked, and the
 * page disappeared. Everything in here exists because its absence produced a
 * specific failure a pupil could see.
 *
 * Addressed to the model and therefore in English and not a Paraglide message,

 * for the prose, which the last paragraph asks for in their language.
