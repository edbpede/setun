/**
 * Deleting a whole classroom (PRD §16, §21).
 *
 * The panel could delete a pupil but never the room they were in, so a
 * classroom set up by mistake stayed on the dashboard for good.
 *
 * The two things the foreign-key cascade cannot reach are what these tests are
 * about: the search index is a virtual table with no foreign keys, so a pupil's
 * text would stay indexed — stored forever and findable by nobody — and the
 * stored bytes are files, which would stay on the volume with nothing pointing
 * at them. Both are the failure mode that looks like success.
