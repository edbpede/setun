/**
 * Validation for every educator panel form (PRD §5, §8, §9, §10).
 *
 * "Every form action and API endpoint validates through a Valibot schema, no
 * exceptions" (§5). They live together because they share one audience — the
 * `(educator)` routes — and one reason to change: the panel's form set. Splitting
 * one file per form would produce single-export modules with no second importer,
 * which is not what the splitting principle asks for (§6.1).
 *
 * Two shapes appear here, for a reason:
 *
 * - Schemas Superforms drives use plain `v.number()` / `v.boolean()`. Superforms
 *   coerces form data from the schema's own types, and a coercing pipe would
 *   erase the input type it needs to do that — and with it `bind:value`.
 * - Schemas a plain action parses by hand coerce explicitly, because there
 *   everything off a `FormData` is a string.
 *
 * Nothing here writes; the routes hand the parsed output to the query modules.
 * These schemas are the boundary an educator's input crosses, so every bound
 * that matters — a weekday in range, a positive cap, a real timezone — is
 * asserted here rather than trusted downstream.
