 * The on-disk MCP server configuration (PRD §6.2, §11).

 * "Students never configure servers; servers are defined in a version-controlled
 * configuration file on disk — an endpoint is a security decision and belongs in
 * reviewable config — with credentials referenced by environment-variable name,
 * never stored in the database."
 *
 * This is the third operator file of §6.2, beside the Compose file and the
 * `.env`. Nothing in the application can add an entry to it, and nothing in it
 * can travel to a browser: the resolved credential never leaves this module's
 * return value, which only the transport reads.
 *
 * The environment arrives as an argument rather than being read here, so this
 * module stays pure enough for `bun test` to exercise the validation without a
 * populated environment. The one caller that has an environment — the boot
 * path — reads it through `$env/dynamic/private` as everything else does (§5).
