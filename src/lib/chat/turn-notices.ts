 * Why an answer stopped short, in words a pupil can act on (PRD §10, §21).
 *
 * Keyed by the server's own union, so a reason added there without a sentence
 * here fails `svelte-check` rather than reaching a classroom as a blank line —
 * the same discipline `$lib/state/refusals` follows.
 *
 * Shared between the turn as it streams and the same turn after a reload,
 * because those are two renderings of one event and a pupil who reloads must not
 * be told something different. The type import is erased at compile time.
