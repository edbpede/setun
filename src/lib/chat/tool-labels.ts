/**
 * What a pupil is told a tool was (PRD §8, §11, §18).
 *
 * The tool chip above an answer is the most-read line on the most-read surface
 * in the product, and until now it printed the identifier the model calls:
 * "Brugte load_skill", "Brugte generate_image". Those are English snake_case
 * internals in the middle of an otherwise fully Danish page, and they were the
 * only untranslated strings a pupil ever saw.
 *
 * Setun's own two tools get a phrase in the pupil's language. Tools from an MCP
 * server keep their own name, deliberately: that name is the operator's, it is
 * what the classroom's tool allowlist calls the same tool, and inventing a
 * translation for it would leave a pupil and their teacher describing the same
 * thing differently.
 *
 * The two identifiers are repeated here rather than imported from
 * `$lib/server/...`, because a value imported from a server module travels into
 * the client bundle with everything it pulls in. `tool-labels.test.ts` asserts
 * they stay in step with the server's constants, so the duplication cannot drift
 * silently.
