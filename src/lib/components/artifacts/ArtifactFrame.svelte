/**
 * The sandboxed iframe host and its message bridge (PRD §14).
 *
 * "Artifacts execute on a separate origin from the application, in an iframe
 * sandboxed to allow scripts but explicitly *not* same-origin." Dropping
 * `allow-same-origin` gives the frame an opaque origin: it cannot read this
 * page's cookies, storage or DOM even though the URL it loads is one this
 * deployment serves.
 *
 * A consequence worth naming, because it looks like a mistake: every message
 * from the frame arrives with `event.origin === "null"`, so origin checking is
 * useless here and `event.source` is the identity that actually holds — it is a
 * window reference this component created and no other page can forge.
 *
 * The same opaque origin is why this component fetches the sandbox's own pinned
 * files on its behalf: an opaque origin is the worst position from which to ask
 * for a subresource, and this page is an ordinary origin for which the same GET
 * is unremarkable. `$lib/artifacts/assets` has the account. Every path the frame
 * names is checked against `isSandboxAssetPath` first, so this reads two
 * directories on the sandbox origin and can be pointed nowhere else.
 */

/**
 * One copy per origin for the lifetime of the tab.
 *
 * Module-level rather than per-component: the compiler's WebAssembly is thirteen
 * megabytes, and a pupil who opens a second artifact — or the same panel twice —
 * must not pay for it again. The browser's own cache would usually cover that,
 * but "usually" is doing too much work for a file this size.
