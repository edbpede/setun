 * One field's validation message (PRD §20, §21).

 * Every one of these carries `role="alert"`, which is the whole point of the

 * screen reader announced: the only live region on the page carried the page
 * title, so a pupil or an educator using one was told a form had been submitted
 * and never told it had been refused.
 *
 * A component rather than a convention, because a convention is what forty
 * hand-written spans had already failed to keep — one of them had the role and
 * the rest did not.
 *
 * `role="alert"` rather than `aria-live="polite"`: a validation message is the
 * answer to something the reader just did, and waiting for a pause to say a
 * field was rejected is waiting too long.
