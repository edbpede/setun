/**
 * The two panes and the divider between them (PRD §13, §20).
 *
 * The conversation and the thing being built are one workspace rather than two
 * screens: the composer is never covered, so a pupil can look at what the model
 * made and ask for a change without first putting it away. That was the whole
 * cost of the overlay this replaces — every question about an artifact began
 * with closing the artifact.
 *
 * One geometry, expressed along whichever axis the viewport allows. Wide enough
 * for two readable columns and the divider is vertical; below that the build
 * surface is a sheet under the conversation and the same divider is its grab
 * handle. `flex-basis` in per cent means one number drives both.
 *
 * The build pane is hidden rather than unmounted while the pupil reads, whenever
 * something is running: an artifact holds state a pupil built up, and tearing
 * the frame down to glance at the conversation throws all of it away (§13).
