/**
 * One position of the workspace switcher, drawn as the screen it produces.
 *
 * Setun's build state is already a trit — three slots, one filled — and the
 * workspace is three-valued in the same way, so the switcher repeats that
 * rhythm without repeating that glyph: circles mean *how a thing ran*, and
 * rectangles mean *what is on screen*. Reusing the trit here would have made one
 * shape mean two things, which is the opposite of why the trit works.
 *
 * The divider follows the real axis, because a vertical rule on a screen that
 * stacks its panes is a small lie about what the control is about to do.
 *
 * Decorative: the switcher's own radio carries the accessible name.
