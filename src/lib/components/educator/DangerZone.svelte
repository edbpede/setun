/**
 * Deleting a classroom (PRD §16, §17).
 *
 * §16 asks the panel to "clearly distinguish disabling, removal from a class,
 * and permanent deletion", and it did — for pupils. The container had no
 * deletion at all, so a room set up by mistake stayed on the dashboard for good.
 *
 * The friction is the pupil deletion's, because the same thing is true here and
 * more so: the educator retypes the name. Below it, the counts — a decision to
 * delete a class is made knowing how many pupils, conversations and creations go
 * with it, and counts are all §16 lets the panel show of them.
 *
 * Last on the page, in its own bordered block, because nothing above it is
 * irreversible and this is.
