/**
 * An artifact where its block was written (PRD §13, §20).
 *
 * The transcript used to render an artifact as a fenced code block: a screenful
 * of markup between two sentences, which is what a fence means to a markdown
 * renderer and not what it means here. An artifact is a live document with a
 * surface of its own, so the transcript shows what was built and one control
 * that opens it.
 *
 * The whole card is that control rather than a button parked on its end: a
 * pupil taps the thing, not a word beside the thing. It also says when it is the
 * one currently on screen, which is what turns a column of similar cards into a
 * way of moving between builds.
 *
 * The identity — id, language, revision — is set in the mono face, everywhere
 * and always, so code-things read as code-things across the interface.
