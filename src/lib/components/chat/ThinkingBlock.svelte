 * its state without a store, and is already a disclosure to a screen reader. The
 * answer is what the pupil asked for; the reasoning is there for the pupil who
 * wants to see how it was reached.
 *
 * The body is plain paragraphs and text nodes only. The model wrote this, and a
 * model's output is untrusted — nothing here parses markdown or produces
 * `{@html}` (§21).
 *
 * While the turn is live the summary counts seconds and shows the latest
 * headline, so a pupil watching a long reasoning pass can see it moving. Once
 * the answer starts arriving it settles to "Thoughts" and stops ticking: a timer
 * running under a finished answer is noise.
