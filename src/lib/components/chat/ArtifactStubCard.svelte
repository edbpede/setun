 * An artifact that is still arriving (PRD §13, §20).

 * `ArtifactCard`'s chrome without its content: while a turn streams there are no
 * refs yet, so there is nothing to open, nothing to preview and no revision to
 * name. What it does say is that something is being built and what it is called,
 * which is the whole difference between watching a page appear and watching
 * `<!doctype html>` scroll past.
 *
 * No `data-artifact-card`: that attribute means "this opens an artifact", and
 * the end-to-end suite reads it as such.
