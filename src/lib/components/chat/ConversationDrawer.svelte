 * is no persistent application header and the sidebar is an overlay rather than
 * a permanent column" (§20). At 1366 pixels wide a permanent column would cost a
 * quarter of the reading width for a list that is consulted between lessons, not
 * during one — and the build surface is what that width is now for.
 *
 * It is also where everything that is not the lesson lives: starting a new
 * conversation, the rest of the pupil's navigation, how the interface is
 * coloured, and signing out.
 *
 * Hand-rolled rather than a dialog primitive: this is a plain panel with a
 * scrim, it must not trap the page in a modal while a turn is streaming behind
 * it, and it costs no additional JavaScript on a route with a 250 KB budget.
