 * something with, so the rules around it are unusually strict and are all
 * enforced here rather than assumed from the screen:
 *
 * - **Every action re-guards itself.** A page `load`'s guard does not run before
 *   a form action, which is the same reason the educator panel's actions each
 *   re-check the role. Setup completion is re-read per action, and every step
 *   past the claim re-verifies the claim and slides it.
 * - **`404`, not `403`, once setup is complete.** A `403` would confirm the
 *   surface exists (§21).
 * - **Progress is derived, never carried.** The step comes from the URL, clamped
 *   against what the persisted rows justify; nothing trusts a hidden field.
 *
 * Thin by §6.1: parse, authorise, delegate to `$lib/server/setup`, shape the
 * response. The decisions live in `claim.ts`, `state.ts` and `steps.ts`.
