/**
 * Student login (PRD §7).
 *
 * A trivial form, so a plain progressively-enhanced action rather than Superforms
 * (§5) — but still Valibot-validated, because every action validates through a
 * schema without exception (§5).
 *
 * The route is thin by design: it parses, delegates the decision to
 * `$lib/server/auth`, and shapes the response. Every *credential* failure is one
 * branch, so there is nothing for the response to disclose about whether a code
 * exists (§7, §21); a refused address is reported separately, because it says
 * nothing about a code and a pupil can act on it.
