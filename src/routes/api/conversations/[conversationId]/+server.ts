 * Switch which branch of the message tree the conversation reads (PRD §10).
 *
 * Editing a prompt or regenerating a reply appends a sibling and leaves the
 * older branch addressable but off-screen; this is how the pupil walks back to
 * it. Given a message at a branch point, the active leaf moves to the tip of
 * that branch, so the whole variant reappears. Owner-scoped, and the target must
 * live in this conversation — otherwise absent and not-yours are one answer.
 *
 * Refused while a turn streams: the turn moves the active leaf itself when it
 * finishes, so a switch accepted now is either silently reverted by that write
 * or silently discards the answer it was racing. The composer already hides the
 * picker mid-turn, but a second tab has not heard about the lock — so, as with
 * sending, the server is what enforces it (§10).
