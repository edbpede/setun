    """
    The sandbox is always served from its build, never from Vite's dev server.

    This service exists only where Caddy does not. With `--production` the same
    `build-sandbox/` directory is mounted into Caddy and served by the same
    `file_server` a deployment uses, so running Vite's preview server beside it
    would be a second answer to a question that already has one.

    Not a performance choice — the dev server cannot serve a working sandbox at
    all. The runner document is sandboxed without `allow-same-origin`, so its
    origin is opaque, and a document with an opaque origin may not fetch a
    subresource from an `http://` origin on the local network. Vite's dev server
    serves unbundled ES modules, which is nothing but such subresources: the
    runner's own module, and every module it imports. None of them load, the
    runner never posts `ready`, and the artifact panel waits on a build that
    cannot start.

    The build inlines the runner into `index.html` for the same reason, which
    leaves the pinned runtimes as the only files the origin still serves. So the
    built sandbox works and the dev-server sandbox cannot, and there is no
    version of this worth offering as a choice.

    The sandbox reads its port from SETUN_SANDBOX_PORT (sandbox/vite.config.ts
    binds it with strictPort), so only the level is passed on the command line.
